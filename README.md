## Quick Background
I was simply exhausted between having to google and bounce back and forth between matchdays, current standings, if I wanted to filter by team or if I wanted to see a particular matchday. This application eases that process for me. I often find myself on my laptop, and when I need quick updates on who's leading the table, or how many goals against a team might have, I refer back to this application. 

Although this application is mostly a front-end, single paged application, I hope in the future to implement more features in order to make this project a bit more detailed, useful, and a tad more stylish.
